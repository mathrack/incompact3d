Folders are named gXaY:
 - X is the fluid-to-solid thermal diffusivity ratio
   * X = G1 in my PhD
   * X = G in my paper in IJHFF (2015)
   * X = G in my paper in IJHMT (2016)
 - Y is the fluid-to-solid thermal conductivity ratio
   * Y = 1/G2 in my PhD
   * Y = G2 in my paper in IJHFF (2015)      !!!!!     THIS IS A TYPO. But the paper deals only with G2=1.
   * Y = 1/G2 in my paper in IJHMT (2016)

They contain:
 - one excel file with the results in wall-units
 - one csv folder that is produced by the scilab script
 - one raw folder that is used as input for the scilab script

The simulations were performed with the source code present in the folder g1a1, except for the file user_module.f90 that is case dependent and can be found in each corresponding directory. Please note that the scilab scripts are not included as they are almost identical to the one in folder g1a1.
